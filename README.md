Title: PREDICTING VASOVAGAL REACTIONS BASED ON FACIAL ACTION UNITS DURING BLOOD DONATION: A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

Student: Dionne Spaltman 

Summary: This project is part of the FAINT project, investigating the feasibility of predicting vasovagal reactions (VVRs) in blood donors using video recordings taken during the donation process.
