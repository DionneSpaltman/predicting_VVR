**Title**: Predicting Vasovagal Reactions Based on Facial Action Units During Blood Donation: A Machine Learning Approach

**Student**: Dionne Spaltman

**Abstract**: To maintain an adequate blood supply, it is crucial for blood collection centers to retain donors. Vasovagal reactions (VVRs), extreme emotional and physical responses, can deter donors from returning. For this reason, the FAINT project explores methods to measure unconscious microexpressions preceding a VVR to prevent its occurrence. This study uniquely utilized video recordings of donors in the donation chair, capturing their facial microexpressions using OpenFace software. It is the first study to use such recordings for this purpose. Four machine learning models were employed to classify donors into the low VVR (no significant reactions) or high VVR group. Participants included a control group (N = 78), a sensitive group (N = 48), and a group of first-time donors (N = 152). Three feature sets were used: pre-donation self-reported VVR levels, microexpression intensity, and their combination. The Support Vector Machine, using only pre-donation VVR levels, performed best, achieving an F1-score of 0.86 for the low VVR class and 0.74 for the high VVR class. While microexpression intensity could predict VVRs, pre-donation VVR levels alone provided good accuracy. Thus, using camera equipment to extract facial microexpressions offers only marginal improvement and may be redundant. The practical implications suggest that pre-donation VVR levels may suffice for prediction, reducing the need for additional equipment. Future research should focus on the anticipatory period in the waiting room to enhance VVR prediction accuracy.
